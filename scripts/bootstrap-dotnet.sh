# bootstrap-dotnet.sh -- install the exact SDK global.json pins, no judgement call needed.
#
# ./scripts/validate.sh full cannot run at all until dotnet reports the pinned patch, and
# scripts/doctor.sh can only diagnose that gap, not close it. This script closes it:
#
#   ./scripts/bootstrap-dotnet.sh
#
# It installs into a REPO-LOCAL .dotnet/, in the PRIMARY checkout, never into $HOME and
# never system-wide. That is a deliberate, considered choice, not the path of least
# resistance:
#   - no global PATH edit is ever required, so the system SDK stays the default for
#     every other project on the machine;
#   - one install has to serve every worktree tools/dispatch-agent.sh creates, since all
#     implementation happens in a worktree and a worktree has no .dotnet of its own.
# The costs are accepted knowingly, not hidden: .dotnet/ is large, `git clean -xfd`
# would delete it, and this framework's `dotnet` differs from the one on PATH. Both are written
# down in README.md so the next session does not have to rediscover them.
#
# It does NOT edit a shell profile, and will not tell you to. scripts/doctor.sh states
# plainly that it never changes the environment; a bootstrap that rewrites ~/.bashrc
# would make that untrue of the pair. scripts/lib/dotnet-env.sh is how validate.sh and
# doctor.sh find what this script installs, with no PATH change needed anywhere.
#
# No sudo, ever. Nothing outside the repository is touched.
