## Purpose

<!-- Why does this Issue exist? What becomes possible when it closes? -->

## Source

<!-- RULES WORK: <sourceId> / <section> / printed p. X / PDF p. Y
     Identify the location precisely enough to implement from. Cite it; do not paste it.
     NON-RULES WORK: N/A -->

N/A

## Exact scope

<!-- Precisely what is being built. One concern. If it needs "and", it is two Issues. -->

## Non-goals

<!-- What this Issue deliberately does NOT do. This is what keeps the PR reviewable. -->

## Acceptance criteria

<!-- Observable conditions that make this Issue closeable. -->

## Required tests/evidence

<!-- What must be demonstrated, and how. Where the authoritative source prints a finite table, the whole
     table is verified, not a sample. -->

## Dependencies

<!-- Issues, ADRs or phases this depends on. "None" is a valid answer. -->

None.

## Known ambiguity

<!-- None, or an explicit description. If the source is genuinely ambiguous this Issue is
     state:needs-decision and an implementation agent may not resolve it. -->

None.

## Risk

<!-- What breaks if this is done wrong, and how far the damage spreads. -->
