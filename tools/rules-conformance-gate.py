"""rules-conformance-gate -- the merge gate that makes rules-conformance review a fact
about GitHub, not a claim a PR body makes about itself.

Issue #41: `pr-policy` already requires a "Rules conformance" section in the PR body
whenever a rules surface changed, but that section is prose -- typing a page number into
a text box does not demonstrate that an adversarial review against the source packet
actually ran, let alone that it passed. This script is the one place that demonstration
is checked mechanically, for the commit GitHub is about to merge.

    tools/rules-conformance-gate.py --pr 108
    tools/rules-conformance-gate.py --pr 108 --json gate-evidence.json
    tools/rules-conformance-gate.py --changed-files files.txt --labels risk:rules-conformance \
                                     --statuses-file statuses.json

GitHub's ruleset cannot require a status check conditionally on which paths a PR
touches: a required check applies to every PR on the branch, or none. So this check
always runs, and decides for itself whether it has anything to check:

  * the PR's diff touches no configured rules surface -- PASS, trivially. Docs and
    tooling work is never blocked by a review with nothing to review.
  * it touches one -- PASS only if a verdict is recorded for THIS EXACT HEAD COMMIT.
    Verdicts are GitHub commit statuses (see tools/record-verdict.sh), which are
    intrinsically tied to one SHA: amending the PR produces a new SHA with no status of
    its own, so an old verdict cannot silently keep covering new code.

The "did a rules surface change" question is not re-decided here: it is delegated to
tools/lib/rules-surface.sh, the same file tools/review-packet.sh uses, so a reviewer's
packet and this gate can never disagree about what counts as rules work.

For an Issue labelled risk:rules-conformance, a second, independent verdict is required
too (docs/agent-team.md, AGENTS.md) -- the in-house agent's verdict alone is not enough
for the mechanics this label exists to flag. That independent verdict is not pinned to
one vendor: it follows an ordered fallback chain -- Codex, then Gemini, then an in-house
second pass only when neither vendor is reachable (Issue #83, ADR
0010-independent-verdict-fallback-chain.md). Each vendor posts to its own named context,
so INDEPENDENT_CONTEXTS below is the set of acceptable contexts, not a single string.

The chain advances on a vendor being UNREACHABLE, not on disagreement: the gate is
satisfied by any ONE recorded pass among INDEPENDENT_CONTEXTS, but ONLY if no context in
the chain has a recorded fail. A vendor that returned a verdict was available, so a later
pass elsewhere may not silently overwrite an earlier fail -- that would let a fail be
cleared by retrying against a different vendor, deciding disagreement by retry order
instead of the source packet (docs/agent-team.md: "Where they disagree, the source
packet decides -- not seniority, not the model, not the implementer's explanation").
Only the ABSENCE of a verdict at a context may be skipped over.
