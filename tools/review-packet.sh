# docs/agent-team.md and .claude/skills/rules-review/SKILL.md say never to brief a
# verifier with "review this PR" -- hand it a bounded packet instead. A read-only
# reviewer (repo-steward, rules-conformance) has no Bash, so it cannot produce a diff
# for itself; this script is the one place that diff gets built, so every reviewer sees
# the same bytes assembled the same way regardless of which PR briefed them.
#
# Packets in this project are routinely generated BEFORE a PR is opened -- that is the
# normal repo-steward/rules-conformance dispatch workflow, not an edge case -- so the PR
# section is best-effort: --pr names one explicitly, and without it the branch name is
# looked up. Either way, when none is found the packet says so in as many words rather
# than silently omitting the section.
#
# Prints the packet to stdout by default -- the tool never touches the repository
# unless told to. Pass --output to write a file, which must resolve outside the
# repository (or to a path the repository already ignores): review packets are
# ephemeral, exactly like the source packets tools/source-slice.py produces, and must
# never be committed.

## Acceptance criteria (Issue #$ISSUE)

$acceptance

## Source locator (Issue #$ISSUE, verbatim)

${source_section:-N/A}

The line above is the Issue's ## Source section, carried verbatim -- never the excerpt
itself. N/A means Issue #$ISSUE is not rules work; otherwise, fetch the actual excerpt
separately with tools/source-slice.py. This holds as long as that section is actually a
locator and not pasted rulebook prose -- this script does not check that shape (only
new-issue.sh's page-number check does, and only at filing time), so verify it yourself
if this is rules work.

## Changed files

$changed_files

## Diff ($range, -U$CONTEXT)

$diff_text

## Determinism risk prompt

Does this diff touch random consumption, ordering, replay, wall-clock time, or
environment/filesystem reads? Would it change how many random values a mechanic
consumes -- that shifts every subsequent result. Check literal patterns against
BANNED_IN_ENGINE in tools/repo-checks.py (also enforced mechanically over src/**/*.cs
by \`tools/repo-checks.py --only determinism\`, part of validate.sh full).

## Decisions already recorded (all ADRs -- judge relevance yourself)

## Gates expected to pass

## Touches a configured rules surface or the source manifest?
