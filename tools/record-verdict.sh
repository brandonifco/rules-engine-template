# Issue #41: a rules-conformance review that lives only in an agent's chat transcript is
# a claim, not a merge gate. This is the ONE place a verdict becomes a fact GitHub can
# check: a commit status, posted directly against the head SHA it was verified against.
# tools/rules-conformance-gate.py reads these back (as
# repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits/{sha}/status) when it decides whether a PR touching a
# rules surface may merge.
#
# A commit status is intrinsically tied to one SHA -- there is no "amend the PR and keep
# the verdict" failure mode to guard against separately, because amending produces a new
# SHA that simply has no status of its own yet.
#
# `--reviewer rules-conformance` is the in-house agent's verdict, always required. The
# independent verdict a risk:rules-conformance Issue also requires (AGENTS.md,
# docs/agent-team.md) is not pinned to one vendor: it follows an ordered fallback chain --
# `codex` first, then `gemini`, then `in-house-independent` only when neither vendor is
# reachable (Issue #83, ADR 0010-independent-verdict-fallback-chain.md). Each reviewer
# posts to its own context (rules-verdict/<reviewer>), so a merged commit's statuses
# name which vendor actually produced the second verdict rather than hiding a
# same-vendor fallback behind a generic name. `in-house-independent` is the fallback of
# last resort, not an equivalent option: a second reviewer from the same model family as
# the implementer tends to reproduce the implementer's misreading, which is the entire
# reason a cross-vendor verdict is required in the first place (AGENTS.md, ADR 0010).
#
# This script does not and cannot verify WHICH model actually produced a verdict, or
# choose one on the caller's behalf: that a human or agent invoking this with `--reviewer
# codex` actually ran Codex rather than a different reviewer, is a process obligation
# this file records but does not enforce -- the caller decides which reviewer ran and
# this script only validates and records that (Issue #83 non-goals: no automatic vendor
# selection here). Say so plainly rather than implying otherwise (docs/agent-team.md, and
# Issue #12's standard).
